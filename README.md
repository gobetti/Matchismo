# Matchismo

This repository is my solution for one of the projects required by the Stanford iOS 7 course. This name was chosen by the Stanford professor, in case you are wondering :)

The code from the first commit was originally written during the course, in January 2014. At the moment, I had no work experience as a developer. Now, more than 2 years later, the idea is to improve that code, which will also require me to remember some of the Objective-C specifics.
