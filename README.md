# Matchismo

This repository is my solution for one of the projects required by the Stanford iOS 7 course. This code was originally written during the course, downloaded from iTunes U, in January 2014. At the moment, I had no work experience with programming. Now, the idea is to improve that code, which will also require me to remember some of the Objective-C specifics.
